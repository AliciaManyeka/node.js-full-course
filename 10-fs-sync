// SYNCHRONOUSLY READING FILES APPROACH

// fs means file system.is a built-in module that provides an API for interacting with the file system. It allows you to perform various operations on files and directories, such as 1  reading, writing, creating, deleting, and renaming them

// >>>>THESE ARE METHODS WE USE TO CREATE FILES FROM SCRATCH AND READ FILES

// method>>>create  variable and provide a path to a file to read
const { readFileSync, writeFileSync } = require("fs");

const first = readFileSync("./content/first.txt", "utf8");
const second = readFileSync("./content/second.txt", "utf8");

// create a new file to write the result
// method>>>is writeFileSync method creates a new file or overwrites an existing file....How it works we provide two values or arguments which is going to be the file name and the value that we would like like to pass and life the file is not there node creates the file for us
writeFileSync(
  "./content/result-sync.txt",
  `Here is the result:${first}, ${second}`,
  { flag: "a" }
);
